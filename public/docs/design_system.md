## Font & Colours

Font used: 'Trebuchet MS'
    This is the same font that is used on the portfolio website, so it will go nicely.

Colours used: Black, White, #ff6f61
    FF6F61 is the same color used as an accent on the portfolio website, so we will continue the theme here in places that will need a spot of color. To make it easier, the dice faces themselves will be png images.
