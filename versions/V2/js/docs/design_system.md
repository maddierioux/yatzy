# Yatzy Game Documentation

## HEaders and Footers 
The header and footer are designed to create a clean look. 
We went with a dark background color (#333) and white text to ensure high contrast and readability.

## Main Area 

The main area uses a white background to keep the focus on the game content.
We made sure it has padding and a box-shadow to give it a distinct, nice look.

## Buttons 

Buttons have a dark background and white text, with a hover effect to enhance interactivity. They are designed to stand out

## Font & Size

    This is the same font that is used on the portfolio website, so it will go nicely.

- Default browser size (typically 16px)
- larger sizes for headings and scoreboard items to enhance readability.

    The dice wil be visually represented by pngs. This will make is easier to change the images for rolling and rerolling, and will help to decrease the errors that could happening if we were to create the die by hand.
